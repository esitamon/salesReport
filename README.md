# salesReport
A dashboard displaying a hypothetical sales report across teams.
# Problem
Create a Python application that will read from 3 input files and use the data within to produce 2 output 
files. The 5 filenames should be taken as command-line parameters such as the following example
*python report.py -t TeamMap.csv -p ProductMaster.csv -s Sales.csv 
--team-report=TeamReport.csv --product-report=ProductReport.csv*
